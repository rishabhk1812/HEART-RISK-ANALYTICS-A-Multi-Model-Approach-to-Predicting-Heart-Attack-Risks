# HEART-RISK-ANALYTICS-A-Multi-Model-Approach-to-Predicting-Heart-Attack-Risks
This project, Heart-Risk Analytics, leverages machine learning models—Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost—to predict heart attack risks. By preprocessing health data, training models, and evaluating performance, it identifies risk levels with precision, aiding proactive healthcare decisions.
